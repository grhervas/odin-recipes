        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I have tried a lot of good roasted potato recipes, but I keep coming back to this one. I've never found one I like better! These are crispy on the outside, and soft and creamy on the inside.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 pounds red potatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>¼ cup sour cream (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan or cast iron skillet with cooking spray; pour in about 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to coat the bottom.</li>
            <li>Mix Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Blot the cut-side of potatoes with a paper towel to remove any moisture. Place potatoes in a bowl and drizzle with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil; toss until potatoes are lightly coated. Sprinkle potatoes with Parmesan cheese mixture; toss to coat. Arrange potatoes, cut-side down, onto the prepared baking pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Turn potatoes to cut-side up; continue baking until golden and crispy, about 15 to 20 more minutes. Serve with sour cream.</li>
        </ol>
